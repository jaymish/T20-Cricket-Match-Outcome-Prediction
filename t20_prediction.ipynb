    "## 📘 Abstract\n",
    "This project develops a pre‑match prediction model for T20 cricket outcomes using structured metadata from the Cricsheet T20 archive. A total of 3,113 matches were parsed and transformed through a fully reproducible pipeline that includes metadata extraction, chronological cleaning, venue–country mapping, and domain‑driven feature engineering. The prediction task is formulated as a binary classification problem, where the objective is to determine whether Team 1 will win a match before it begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering incorporates contextual, historical, and rivalry‑based indicators such as toss outcome, home advantage, recent form, season‑specific performance, and multiple head‑to‑head metrics (overall, weighted, and venue‑specific). Eight supervised learning models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, K‑Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, a deep multi‑layer perceptron, and AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all models, Logistic Regression achieved the highest F1 score (0.593), indicating that the engineered features align strongly with linear and additive decision boundaries. These results demonstrate that carefully designed pre‑match metadata features can provide meaningful predictive power in T20 cricket, and they establish a foundation for future extensions incorporating player‑level statistics, pitch conditions, and ball‑by‑ball dynamics."

    "## 📖 Introduction\n",
    "Predicting the outcome of T20 cricket matches is a challenging problem due to the fast‑paced nature of the format, high variance in team performance, and the strong influence of contextual factors such as venue, toss decisions, and recent form. Unlike longer formats of cricket, T20 matches provide limited time for teams to recover from early setbacks, making pre‑match prediction both analytically interesting and practically valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a fully reproducible, pre‑match prediction model that determines whether Team 1 will win a T20 match using only metadata available before the first ball is bowled. This ensures a realistic and leakage‑free formulation of the prediction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this study consists of 3,113 T20 matches from the Cricsheet archive. Only match‑level metadata is used; ball‑by‑ball information, player‑level statistics, and in‑match events are intentionally excluded to maintain a strict pre‑match perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contributes:\n",
    "- A complete parsing and cleaning pipeline for Cricsheet metadata  \n",
    "- A domain‑driven feature engineering framework incorporating contextual, historical, and rivalry‑based indicators  \n",
    "- A comparative evaluation of eight supervised learning models  \n",
    "- A transparent and academically rigorous workflow suitable for replication and extension  \n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this notebook follows a structured progression: data extraction, cleaning, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and interpretation of results."

    "## 📚 Literature Survey\n",
    "Sports analytics research has increasingly focused on predictive modeling using structured match‑level data, and cricket has emerged as a rich domain due to the availability of detailed public datasets such as Cricsheet. Early work by Kaluarachchi and Aparna (2010) demonstrated that pre‑match factors—including venue, toss outcome, and team strength—significantly influence match results in ODI cricket. Sankaranarayanan et al. (2014) extended this approach to T20 cricket, showing that historical performance metrics and contextual variables improve predictive accuracy. Bunker and Thabtah (2019) further emphasized the importance of domain‑specific feature engineering, arguing that handcrafted features often outperform raw statistical inputs in sports prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recent studies have reinforced these findings. Beal et al. (2021) highlighted the predictive value of temporal features such as recent form and season‑specific performance, while also noting the challenges of avoiding data leakage in sports datasets. Their work supports the use of chronologically ordered feature computation, which is central to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collectively, these studies motivate the formulation used here: a binary classification model based solely on pre‑match metadata, enriched with contextual, historical, and rivalry‑based engineered features. This project builds on prior work by implementing a fully reproducible pipeline tailored to T20 cricket and by incorporating multiple head‑to‑head metrics, venue‑specific adjustments, and season‑based strength indicators.\n",

    "## 🧮 Machine Learning Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This project frames T20 match outcome prediction as a **binary classification problem**, where the objective is to determine whether **Team 1** will win a match before it begins. The target variable represents a simple win/lose outcome, and all input features are derived exclusively from **pre‑match metadata** to ensure a leakage‑free setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature set includes contextual, historical, and rivalry‑based indicators such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Toss outcome and toss decision  \n",
    "- Venue and home‑advantage markers  \n",
    "- Historical team strength  \n",
    "- Recent form based on rolling win rates  \n",
    "- Season‑specific performance metrics  \n",
    "- Head‑to‑head rivalry statistics  \n",
    "- Relative performance differences between the two teams  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these features, multiple supervised learning models are trained to estimate the likelihood of a Team 1 victory. The models evaluated in this project include Logistic Regression, K‑Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, a deep MLP, and AdaBoost. Each model outputs a probability score indicating how likely Team 1 is to win, which is then converted into a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation provides a clear, structured approach to predicting match outcomes using interpretable, domain‑driven features."

    "\n",
    "This project uses the Cricsheet T20 (male) dataset, which contains detailed information for 3,114 individual T20 cricket matches. Each match is stored in its own CSV file, and the archive includes matches from a wide range of teams, tournaments, and years. The README provided with the dataset lists all matches included in the archive, with each entry showing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Match date  \n",
    "- Match type (international or domestic)  \n",
    "- Format (T20)  \n",
    "- Gender category  \n",
    "- Match ID (also used as the filename)  \n",
    "- Teams involved  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "2025-12-19 – international – T20 – male – 1479580 – India vs South Africa\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the file `1479580.csv` contains the full data for that match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each match file follows a consistent structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`version` line** – indicates the dataset schema version.  \n",
    "- **`info` rows** – contain match-level metadata such as teams, venue, city, toss winner, toss decision, match winner, season, and date.  \n",
    "- **`ball` rows** – contain ball-by-ball events including innings, over and ball number, batter, bowler, runs, extras, and wicket details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we focus exclusively on the **match-level metadata** found in the `info` rows, as these fields represent information available *before* the match begins. This allows us to build a clean and realistic pre-match prediction model. The ball-by-ball section is valuable for advanced analytics but is not required for the scope of this term project."

    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce dynamic, performance‑based features that capture how teams perform over time. These features significantly improve predictive accuracy because they reflect momentum, rivalry patterns, and season‑specific team strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Recent Form (Last 5 Matches)\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams often go through hot streaks or slumps. To quantify short‑term momentum, we compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **team1_recent_form**  \n",
    "  Rolling win rate of team1 over its last 5 matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **team2_recent_form**  \n",
    "  Rolling win rate of team2 over its last 5 matches (computed using the complement of team1’s win).\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature captures immediate performance trends and is widely used in sports analytics to model momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Head‑to‑Head Strength (H2H)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some teams consistently outperform others due to matchup‑specific advantages.  \n",
    "We compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **h2h_strength**  \n",
    "  Historical win rate of team1 against team2 across all previous encounters.  \n",
    "  If the teams have never met, we assign a neutral value of **0.5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature captures long‑term rivalry dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2A. Weighted Head‑to‑Head Strength\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all past matches carry equal importance. Teams evolve over time, and recent encounters are often more predictive than older ones.  \n",
    "To account for this, we compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **h2h_weighted**  \n",
    "  An exponentially weighted H2H score where recent matches receive higher weight and older matches gradually decay in influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the model to emphasize current rivalry trends rather than outdated historical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2B. Venue‑Specific Head‑to‑Head Strength\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams often perform differently depending on the venue:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subcontinent teams excel on spin‑friendly pitches  \n",
    "- Australia and South Africa perform strongly on fast, bouncy surfaces  \n",
    "- Neutral venues (e.g., UAE) often level the playing field  \n",
    "\n",
    "To capture this, we compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **h2h_venue_specific**  \n",
    "  Historical win rate of team1 against team2 *restricted to similar venue conditions*:\n",
    "  - Matches played in team1’s home country  \n",
    "  - Matches played in team2’s home country  \n",
    "  - Matches played at neutral venues  \n",
    "\n",
    "If no matches exist in the relevant venue category, we fall back to the overall H2H average.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature models rivalry under comparable playing conditions, making it highly predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Season‑Based Strength\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams vary in strength from season to season due to changes in squad composition, coaching staff, and player form.  \n",
    "We compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **team1_season_strength** → team1’s win rate in that specific season  \n",
    "- **team2_season_strength** → team2’s win rate in that season (complement of team1’s win)\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature helps the model understand how strong each team was during the year of the match, capturing temporal variations in team quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these components — recent form, enhanced head‑to‑head metrics, and season‑based strength — provide temporal and contextual intelligence to the model, enabling more realistic and robust match outcome predictions."

    "## 📌 Explanation of Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating all eight machine learning models, we observe a clear performance pattern that aligns with the structure of our engineered features and the nature of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⭐ Logistic Regression Performs the Best\n",
    "Logistic Regression achieves the highest F1 score. This is expected because the engineered features in this project, such as `strength_diff`, `recent_form_diff`, `season_strength_diff`, `h2h_strength`, and `team1_home` capture relationships that are mostly **linear and additive**. Logistic Regression models these relationships directly and efficiently, making it a strong fit for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⭐ XGBoost and the Deep MLP Are Close Behind\n",
    "Both XGBoost and the MLP capture **mild nonlinear interactions** that Logistic Regression cannot. However, the dataset is not highly nonlinear, and the engineered features already simplify many relationships. As a result, these models perform well but do not surpass Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⭐ Random Forest and AdaBoost Sit in the Middle\n",
    "Random Forest and AdaBoost perform reasonably well but do not reach the top. This is because:\n",
    "- The dataset contains **smooth numeric features** rather than strong hierarchical splits.\n",
    "- One-hot encoded team and venue variables introduce **sparse, high-dimensional inputs**, which tree-based models handle less effectively.\n",
    "- AdaBoost is sensitive to noise and tends to over-focus on misclassified samples, which can reduce generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⭐ Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN Trail Behind\n",
    "- A single Decision Tree lacks the complexity needed for this problem.\n",
    "- SVM performs moderately well but struggles with the high-dimensional one-hot encoded features.\n",
    "- KNN performs the worst because distance-based models do not work well with sparse, high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Summary\n",
    "The results confirm that the engineered features in this project align strongly with linear modeling assumptions. Logistic Regression captures these relationships most effectively, while more complex models offer incremental improvements but do not outperform the simpler baseline.\n"
